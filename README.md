# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator written in Java that generates a random password consisting of 8 characters. The password consists of a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## How to use

To use the password generator, copy the code into a Java playground and run it. The generated password will be printed to the console.

## Example

Here's an example of the password generator in action:

**R7$b2#c3!**


## Customization

You can customize the password generator by changing the `PASSWORD_LENGTH` constant in the `main` method. This will change the length of the generated password. You can also customize the character set used in the password by modifying the `characters` string in the `generatePassword` method.
